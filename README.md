# Scaffolder DSL

Industry first modeling language based on developer friendly principles. Built by developers for everyone else...

## Definition

Scaffolder DSL or SDSL is a concise, declarative and narrow domain specific modeling language for everything related to software design, architecture, development, support, maintenance... Model once and plan, design, develop, run, operate anything, everywhere!

Supports structural and behavior modelling of any software development phase.

## Syntax

From the very early releases SDSL is superset of YAML but later will support many other modeling languages like PlantUML, OCL, DOT, TOML, UML, TextUML, BPML ...

## Why YAML?

YAML is very often used for system configuration and it has always been and will continue to be a complete data serialization language that is perfect for modeling structure of data, software systems, its configuration and is ideal for giving meaningful behavior.

It's either you love or hate YAML but there are also people who "love to hate YAML" and we are working really hard to provide tools to transpile to JSON withing the code editor of choice very easily.
